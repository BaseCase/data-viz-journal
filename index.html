<h1>Human-Centered Data Visualization</h1>

<h2>About</h2>
<p>
  Hello! This website is a log of <a href="https://caseybrant.com">my</a> experience doing an independent study project about data visualizations as part of the <a href="https://madisoncollege.edu">Madison College</a> Graphic Design program. This site is just a blog; the final product will be linked here once it exists.
</p>
