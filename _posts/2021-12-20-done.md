# Done!

The semester is over, and my project is finished! It's visible [right over here](https://human-centered-data.herokuapp.com/).

I'll be doing some deeper reflection in the coming weeks as I get a little distance from the work of the semester, but I think I'd call this a qualified success. I did learn a ton about data visualization and the practices and tools that go into it. I did NOT generate any brand new ideas about data visualization, as I'd initially hoped.

I think what I've learned is that it's simply a much longer road towards developing human-centered designs than I had anticipated. After taking a little break, I plan to continue pushing forward on this work, though, and I'm optimistic that at some point I'll be able to make some inroads there.

Thanks for reading along with me!
