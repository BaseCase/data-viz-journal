# Getting Started

Holy cow, we're already 10 days into September. These first two weeks of the semester have gone by in a blur, and I'm just starting to get this project rolling, so this will be a quick post to say hello and kick things off. I'll talk more about my motivations and goals in a future post to keep this one nice and quick.

## The first two weeks

This is a project about data visualization, and I don't have a lot of relevant knowledge, so I'm starting out with some study of the fundamentals. I just finished working my way through [this pretty good data viz basics course on LinkedIn Learning by Bill Shander](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-data-visualization-3/) and am about to start applying its ideas to some [open Madison data](https://data-cityofmadison.opendata.arcgis.com/). I'm not really sure what I'll find in there, but it seems like a fun place to start exploring!

In that LinkedIn Learning course, Bill says he likes to get familiar with a new set of data by just dumping it into Excel and playing around with the most basic built-in aggregations and charts, and that makes sense to me. I want to build at least some understanding of a particular set of data before I start developing opinions about what kind of story it might be able to tell visually.

## Let's find some stuff

So that's the plan for next week: pick some data from the Madison open data site, convert it into something I can dump into Excel, and play around with it! Should be fun.
